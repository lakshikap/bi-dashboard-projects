**Business Objective:** To enable policy makers, analysts and housing providers to make informed decisions that fuel $10M social housing decisions, to ensure the homeless and at-risk populations are housed, in Canada. 

**Project Team and Organization:** University of Ottawa and Alliance for Homelessness Ottawa. I worked on this project from May to Dec 2024.

- Gathered stakeholder needs and requirements on social housing data gaps from 10+ Government policy makers, analysts and housing providers.
- Designed a conceptual and logical data model to store 20K+ data using SQL Databases in Azure.
- Optimized and migrated database structure by running over 25 SQL queries to create, modify, and enhance tables, improving system performance by 10%.
- Developed 6+ dashboards using Power BI, DAX and SQL database and reduced manual reports by 50% and provided 20+ insightful visualizations.
- Recommended insights to 10+ policy makers and analysts and got buy-in for dashboard solution adoption.

**Outcome:** A dashboard that enable policy makers, analysts and housing providers to make informed decisions that fuel $10M social housing decisions.
